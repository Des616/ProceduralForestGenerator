This was a project for a procedural generation course at UCSC. Thanks to {amsmith,ikarth}@ucsc.edu for the starter code to show the tile/grid and the camera work. 

Thanks to @nlou for showing how to integrate tiles into this project. 

The key in this piece plays a large role. Each different key controls the tree density of the piece. Changing the key will control how many trees are generated and where. I really recommend trying a bunch of them to see how drastically the piece changes.

There is a simulated snowstorm that covers the piece. The snow particles drift similarly to the ones around them. They also lose their brightness at different rates, really creating some interesting diversity.

Credit to https://opengameart.org/content/free-isometric-plants-pack for the tiles which I used.
